# Subs2SRS Deck Generator

Create subs2srs Anki decks from video files using subs2cia. Generates audio clips and subtitle text for flashcard-based language learning.

## CRITICAL: Required Fork of subs2cia

This skill **requires** [mattvsjapan's fork of subs2cia](https://github.com/mattvsjapan/subs2cia). The original/upstream subs2cia will NOT work — it lacks the `context` column, `--export-header-row`, and BCP 47 locale tag support that this skill depends on.

**If a different version of subs2cia is already installed, you MUST uninstall it first:**
```bash
pip3 uninstall subs2cia
pip3 install git+https://github.com/mattvsjapan/subs2cia.git
```

**If the correct fork is already installed, upgrade it to ensure you have the latest features:**
```bash
pip3 install --upgrade git+https://github.com/mattvsjapan/subs2cia.git
```

Do not proceed until the correct fork is installed and up to date.

## Usage

The user provides a source directory containing video files (typically .mp4 with target language audio and subtitles). The skill processes all videos and outputs a single .apkg Anki deck. The user is an English speaker. The default target language is **Japanese**, but the user may specify another language.

## Track Selection

Use ffprobe to inspect available audio and subtitle tracks. Select the tracks matching the user's target language. If there are multiple tracks for the same language, ask the user which to use.

### Default (Japanese)
- **Audio**: `jpn`, `ja`, `japanese`, `日本語`
- **Subtitles**: `jpn`, `ja`, `japanese`, `日本語`

### Other Languages
Adapt track selection to whatever language the user specifies. Use the same ffprobe approach — match by language code and title tags.

### Check Available Input Sources

Before running subs2cia, check for input sources in priority order:

**1. transcript JSON files (preferred)** — Check if there are transcript JSON files alongside the videos:
```bash
ls "$SOURCE_DIR"/*.json 2>/dev/null
```
If JSON files exist, use them as input. subs2cia will use MeCab-based sentence segmentation to produce one card per sentence — this gives better card boundaries than SRT-based splitting. JSON files must be passed explicitly alongside the video in `-i`.

**2. External SRT/ASS files (fallback)** — Check if there are subtitle files alongside the videos:
```bash
ls "$SOURCE_DIR"/*.srt "$SOURCE_DIR"/*.ass 2>/dev/null
```
If external subtitle files exist (e.g., from the create-srt skill), subs2cia will pick them up automatically as long as the filename matches the video (e.g., `video.mp4` + `video.srt`). In this case you don't need `-si` at all.

**3. Embedded tracks (last resort)** — Inspect the video files for embedded audio and subtitle tracks:
```bash
ffprobe -v error -select_streams a -show_entries stream=index:stream_tags=language,title -of csv=p=0 "$SOURCE_DIR"/*.mp4 2>/dev/null | head -5
ffprobe -v error -select_streams s -show_entries stream=index:stream_tags=language,title -of csv=p=0 "$SOURCE_DIR"/*.mp4 2>/dev/null | head -5
```

## Base Command

**Requires [mattvsjapan's fork](https://github.com/mattvsjapan/subs2cia) — see "Required Fork" section above.**

```bash
# -d MUST be a LOCAL temp dir (WORK="$(mktemp -d /tmp/anki_build.XXXXXX)"), NEVER a
# path under Content/ (iCloud). See "Execution Steps" for the full copy-back flow.
# With JSON (preferred — MeCab sentence segmentation)
subs2cia srs -i "video.mp4" "transcript.json" -p 500 -N -d "$WORK/out_srs" --export-header-row

# With SRT (fallback)
subs2cia srs -b -i "*.mp4" -ai 0 -si 0 -p 500 -N -d "$WORK/out_srs" --export-header-row
```

Screenshots are **on by default** — each card's back shows a frame from the line, which the user wants. For very long videos (movies / 2 hr+) you may add `--no-export-screenshot` to halve the work and shrink the deck (the image field is then left empty).

### Parameters Explained

| Flag | Value | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `srs` | - | SRS subcommand (creates Anki-ready output) |
| `-b` | - | Batch mode (process multiple files) |
| `-i` | `"*.mp4" "*.json"` | Input files (video + JSON or video + subtitle) |
| `-ai` | `0` | Audio stream index (only needed with embedded tracks) |
| `-si` | `0` | Subtitle stream index (only needed with embedded tracks) |
| `-p` | `500` | Padding in ms around each subtitle line |
| `-N` | - | Normalize audio levels |
| `-d` | `"$WORK/out_srs"` | Output dir — MUST be a local `/tmp` dir, never under `Content/` (iCloud) |
| `--export-header-row` | - | Include column headers in TSV output |

## Workflow

1. Get the source directory from the user
2. **Check available input sources** — look for transcript JSON files first, then external SRT/ASS, then embedded tracks (see priority order above)
3. **Identify audio tracks** — use ffprobe to find the target language audio stream index (default: Japanese)
4. **Rename source video files if needed** — skip if filenames are already ASCII-safe. Only add episode numbers (`_01`, `_02`) when there are multiple videos. See `process-content.md` for full renaming rules.
5. Navigate to the source directory
6. Run subs2cia with JSON input (preferred) or subtitle track indices (fallback)
7. **Generate episode summaries** - for each TSV, read subtitle text and generate a translation briefing (see Episode Summary Format below), then prepend it to every row's `context` column. Use subagents to process TSVs in parallel, **at most 3 at a time** — for larger batches, run waves of 3, not one subagent per TSV up front.
8. **Combine all TSV files** into a single `combined.tsv`
9. **Export as .apkg** - package the combined TSV and all media files into an Anki .apkg deck **inside the local temp dir**, then copy ONLY the finished `.apkg` to the source directory (the source dir is on iCloud — see Execution Steps).
10. **Clean up** - delete the entire local temp working dir (`$WORK`) and all its intermediate files, leaving only the `.apkg` in the source dir. If an `.anki.srt` was generated from a transcript JSON file, delete it too — the SRT is an intermediate artifact, not a final output. **Do NOT delete the transcript JSON file** — it may be needed by other workflows.
11. Report the output location to the user

## File Naming Convention

Rename source video files to this format before processing:
```
<show_name>_<episode>.mp4
```

This ensures output files automatically follow the naming convention:
- `<show_name>_<episode>_<start>-<end>.mp3`

Examples:
- `kiseijuu_01.mp4` → `kiseijuu_01_585-3377.mp3`
- `oshi_no_ko_s2_13.mp4` → `oshi_no_ko_s2_13_4797-8508.mp3`

Rules for `<show_name>`:
- All lowercase
- Use underscores for spaces
- Include season/year identifiers if relevant (e.g., `s2`, `2020`)

## Execution Steps

```bash
# 1. Store the source folder (the Content library lives on iCloud Drive)
SOURCE_DIR="/path/to/source"

# 1b. CRITICAL: do all heavy intermediate work in a LOCAL temp dir, NOT on iCloud.
#     subs2cia writes thousands of clip/screenshot files; doing that inside the
#     iCloud-synced Content folder makes I/O crawl and can stall the build for hours.
#     Only the final .apkg is copied back to $SOURCE_DIR.
WORK="$(mktemp -d /tmp/anki_build.XXXXXX)"

# 1c. CRITICAL for LONG videos (≳20 min): also copy the INPUTS into the local temp dir
#     and run subs2cia from there. subs2cia demuxes the audio to an intermediate FLAC
#     written NEXT TO THE INPUT file (-d only controls the FINAL output dir, not the
#     demux scratch). If the input sits on iCloud, that FLAC lands on iCloud too, and on
#     a long build iCloud can evict it mid-run — subs2cia then dies with
#     "Error opening input ... .stream1.audio.*.flac: No such file or directory",
#     producing a TRUNCATED deck (e.g. 60 of 928 cards). Copying inputs local keeps the
#     demux FLAC off iCloud. Short clips (a few min) usually finish before iCloud
#     interferes, but copying is always safe — do it whenever the video is long.
mkdir -p "$WORK/in"
cp "$SOURCE_DIR"/*.mp4 "$SOURCE_DIR"/*.json "$WORK/in/" 2>/dev/null   # long videos: run subs2cia against $WORK/in copies
# (For short videos you may skip the copy and point -i directly at $SOURCE_DIR files.)

# 2. Check for JSON files first, then SRT/ASS, then embedded tracks
ls "$SOURCE_DIR"/*.json 2>/dev/null
ls "$SOURCE_DIR"/*.srt "$SOURCE_DIR"/*.ass 2>/dev/null
ffprobe -v error -select_streams a -show_entries stream=index:stream_tags=language,title -of csv=p=0 "$SOURCE_DIR"/*.mp4 2>/dev/null | head -5

# 3. Rename source video files to standard format
# Ask user for the show name (e.g., "kiseijuu", "oshi_no_ko_s2")
SHOW_NAME="<show_name>"
cd "$SOURCE_DIR"
for f in *.mp4; do
  # Extract episode number (handles formats like "E01", "- 01", " 01.")
  num=$(echo "$f" | sed -E 's/.*[E -]([0-9]{2})[.\-].*/\1/')
  mv "$f" "${SHOW_NAME}_${num}.mp4"
done

# 4. Run subs2cia — write ALL output to the LOCAL temp dir ($WORK), never to iCloud.
#    For LONG videos point -i at the LOCAL input copies ($WORK/in/...) from step 1c so the
#    demux FLAC also stays off iCloud (see 1c). Short clips may read from $SOURCE_DIR directly.
#    Screenshots are ON by default — the listening card is audio-front, image+text+context back.
#    For movies / 2 hr+ you may add --no-export-screenshot to halve the work + shrink the deck.
# With JSON (preferred — long video, inputs copied local):
subs2cia srs -i "$WORK/in/video.mp4" "$WORK/in/transcript.json" -p 500 -N -d "$WORK/out_srs" --export-header-row
# With SRT (fallback):
subs2cia srs -b -i "*.mp4" -ai <audio_index> -si <subtitle_index> -p 500 -N -d "$WORK/out_srs" --export-header-row

# 5. Generate episode summaries and prepend to context column
#    Launch subagents (one per TSV, at most 3 at a time) to:
#    a) Read subtitle text from the 'text' column
#    b) Generate a translation briefing (see Episode Summary Format below)
#    c) Prepend "Episode summary: <briefing> | " to every row's context column
#    Use this Python snippet to apply the summary to a single TSV:

# EPISODE_SUMMARY should be set per-file after reading and summarizing the text
python3 dojo-prompts/scripts/prepend_summary.py "$WORK/out_srs"/<filename>.tsv "EPISODE_SUMMARY_HERE"

# 6. Combine all TSV files into a single file (still in the temp dir)
# Use head -q to suppress ==> filename <== separators between files
head -q -1 "$WORK/out_srs"/*.tsv | head -1 > "$WORK/out_srs/combined.tsv" && tail -n +2 -q "$WORK/out_srs"/*.tsv >> "$WORK/out_srs/combined.tsv"

# 7. Export the .apkg INTO the temp dir, then copy ONLY the final file to the iCloud source dir
python3 dojo-prompts/scripts/apkg_export.py "$WORK/out_srs/combined.tsv" "$WORK/out_srs/" "${SHOW_NAME}" "$WORK"
cp "$WORK/${SHOW_NAME}.apkg" "$SOURCE_DIR/"

# 8. Clean up the entire local temp dir (clips, screenshots, flac, tsv all live here)
rm -rf "$WORK"

# 9. Report location of output
ls -la "$SOURCE_DIR/${SHOW_NAME}.apkg"
```

## Episode Summary Format

The episode summary serves as a **translation briefing** for an LLM that will translate individual subtitle lines. It should be a mix of English and the target language, roughly 4-6 sentences, following this structure:

```
This is a line from [show name] ([name in target language]), a [format description] hosted by [host name] ([name in target language]). The guest is [guest name in target language] ([English name if applicable]), [their title/expertise/background]. They discuss [main topic in English and target language], covering [key subtopics]. Key terms that may appear: [domain-specific terms in target language with English translations]. The conversation is [register description — e.g., casual and colloquial].
```

**Example (Japanese):**
```
This is a line from ゆる言語学ラジオ (Yuru Linguistics Radio), a conversational Japanese podcast hosted by 水野太貴 (Mizuno Taiki) and 堀元見 (Horimoto Ken). They discuss linguistic misconceptions (言語学の誤解), covering topics like prescriptivism (規範主義), etymology (語源), and phonological change (音韻変化). Key terms: 言語学 (linguistics), 方言 (dialect), 音韻 (phonology). The tone is casual and humorous, with academic terminology throughout.
```

**Example (Chinese):**
```
This is a line from 博音 (Bo Yin Podcast), a conversational Mandarin Chinese podcast hosted by 博恩 (Brian Tseng). The guest is 何立安博士, a sports science PhD specializing in strength training and physical conditioning. They discuss why people plateau in weight training (重訓卡關), covering topics like training discipline (紀律), progressive overload (漸進式超負荷), and the science behind muscle adaptation. Key terms: 重訓 (weight training), 卡關 (hitting a plateau), 肌肥大 (muscle hypertrophy). The tone is casual and colloquial, with technical fitness terminology throughout.
```

**What to include:**
- Show name and format (podcast, drama, etc.) in both English and the target language
- Host and guest names in both the target language script and romanization
- Guest's title, expertise, and relevant background
- Main topic and subtopics in both English and the target language
- Domain-specific terminology (target language term + English translation)
- Language register and conversational tone

## APKG Export

After combining TSVs, package everything into an Anki .apkg file using the `apkg_export.py` script:

```bash
python3 dojo-prompts/scripts/apkg_export.py "$WORK/out_srs/combined.tsv" "$WORK/out_srs/" "${SHOW_NAME}" "$WORK"
cp "$WORK/${SHOW_NAME}.apkg" "$SOURCE_DIR/"   # copy ONLY the final deck to iCloud
```

### APKG Notes
- The model uses a **listening card** template: front = audio only, back = image (screenshot) + text + context
- Deck and model IDs are derived from the show name so re-importing updates existing cards rather than creating duplicates
- The `genanki` package must be installed (`pip3 install genanki`)
- Screenshots are **enabled by default** in this workflow — `apkg_export.py` embeds the per-line frame into the card's Image field. For movies / 2 hr+ you may add `--no-export-screenshot` for speed and deck size; `apkg_export.py` handles their absence (the image field is left empty).
- The TSV column names (`audioclip`, `screenclip`, `text`, `context`) come from subs2cia's `--export-header-row` output. The `audioclip` column contains `[sound:filename.mp3]` format and `screenclip` contains `<img src='filename.jpg'>` format — both need parsing to extract the bare filename.

## Output

The final output is a single file in the source directory:
- **`<show_name>.apkg`** - complete Anki deck with all audio clips and screenshots embedded (screenshots on by default), ready for direct import into Anki

All intermediate files (TSVs, audio clips, screenshots, the `out_srs/` directory) live in the **local `$WORK` temp dir** and are deleted after the `.apkg` is copied to the source dir — nothing heavy is ever written under `Content/` (iCloud).

## Adjustments

- **Different video format**: Change `*.mp4` to `*.mp4` or other format
- **Different track indices**: Adjust `-ai` and `-si` based on ffprobe output
- **More/less padding**: Adjust `-p` value (default 500ms)

## Notes

- subs2cia requires text-based subtitles (SRT, ASS). Won't work with bitmap subtitles (PGS).
- subs2cia picks up external subtitle files automatically if the filename matches the video (e.g., `video.mp4` + `video.srt`).
- If subtitles are embedded, subs2cia extracts them automatically.
- The .apkg is written directly to the source directory; all intermediate files are cleaned up automatically.
- **Do not proactively check on background jobs.** When a long-running batch process is running in the background, do not poll for progress or read output files unless the user asks. This avoids wasting context window on progress bar output.
- **Long videos: copy inputs to the local temp dir before running subs2cia** (see step 1c). subs2cia writes its demux scratch FLAC next to the *input*, not in `-d`; if the input is on iCloud, a long build can have that FLAC evicted mid-run and die with a `No such file or directory` on `...stream1.audio.*.flac`, yielding a truncated deck. Running against `$WORK/in/` copies avoids this. (Observed on the 30-min Ibaraki prefecture guide: first build died at card 60 of 928.)
