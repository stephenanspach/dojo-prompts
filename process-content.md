# Process Content

Download Japanese content from YouTube and process it into study materials.

## Usage

Run `/process-content` and the skill will walk you through the process.

## Workflow

### 1. Gather everything up front

Ask the user for a YouTube URL. This can be:
- A single video
- A playlist
- A full channel

Then immediately ask what outputs they want:

> I'll download this and transcribe it. What would you like me to generate?
>
> - **Japanese subtitles** — SRT with natural bunsetsu line breaks for watching
> - **English subtitles** — translated SRT for language learning reference
> - **Condensed audio** — extract just the spoken audio for passive listening
> - **Anki deck** — generate flashcards with audio clips and subtitle text
> - **Primed-listening summary** — English-summary SRT (topical chunks) for primed-listening audio
>
> You can pick any combination.

Wait for the user to answer before starting any work.

### 2. Run everything

Once you have the URL and know what they want, execute all steps in sequence without further interaction.

**Download** with yt-dlp:

```bash
# Single video
yt-dlp -f "bv*[ext=mp4]+ba[ext=m4a]/b[ext=mp4]" --merge-output-format mp4 -o "%(title)s.%(ext)s" "URL"

# Playlist or channel
yt-dlp -f "bv*[ext=mp4]+ba[ext=m4a]/b[ext=mp4]" --merge-output-format mp4 -o "%(playlist_index)03d_%(title)s.%(ext)s" "URL"
```

**Sanitize and rename** — Check if filenames need renaming **before any processing**. subs2cia and other tools name their outputs after the input file — if you process before renaming, outputs will have mismatched names.

**Skip renaming if** the filename is already ASCII-safe (no CJK characters, no Unicode punctuation, no special characters that break shell tools). For example, `goldman_sachs_money_mate_01.mp4` is fine as-is.

**Rename if** the filename contains Japanese/Chinese/Korean characters or problematic Unicode. Create a **romanized version of the full title** — not a shortened or translated summary:
- 「機械オンチに「API」を説明する動画」 → `kikai_onchi_ni_api_wo_setsumei_suru_douga`
- 「ゆる言語学ラジオ」 → `yuru_gengogaku_radio`
- 「ゴールドマン・サックス マネーメイト」 → `goldman_sachs_money_mate`

Rules for renaming:
- All lowercase
- Romanize Japanese fully — do not strip it down to just the English/ASCII parts
- Underscores for spaces and punctuation
- Keep English words as-is (e.g. `api`, `radio`)
- Include season/year if relevant (e.g., `_s2`, `_2024`)
- Only add episode numbers (`_01`, `_02`) when there are **multiple videos** in a series. A single standalone video does not need a number suffix.

**Transcribe** — This always runs. Use the **create-srt** skill's steps 1-2 to transcribe each video with ElevenLabs Scribe v2 and produce the Scribe JSON file. Read `create-srt.md` (in the same directory as this file). The JSON is the foundation for all other outputs.

**Japanese subtitles** (if selected) — Run `srt_watch.py` on the JSON with `-o` to name the output after the video file:
```bash
python3 dojo-prompts/scripts/srt_watch.py -o <video_stem> <json_file_path>
```

**English subtitles** (if selected) — Use the **translate-srt** skill. Read the full skill at `translate-srt.md` (in the same directory as this file) and follow its instructions, passing the Scribe JSON file. Use `-o` to name the output after the video file (not the JSON). The intermediate Japanese `.translate.srt` should be deleted after translation is complete.

**Condensed audio** (if selected) — Use the **condensed-audio** skill. Read the full skill at `condensed-audio.md` (in the same directory as this file) and follow its instructions.

**Anki deck** (if selected) — Use the **anki** skill. Read the full skill at `anki.md` (in the same directory as this file) and follow its instructions.

**Primed-listening summary** (if selected) — Use the **primed-summaries** skill. Read the full skill at `primed-summaries.md` (in the same directory as this file) and follow its instructions, passing the Scribe JSON file. The skill itself will ask the user which models to use for the premise and window subagents.

### 3. Report results

Tell the user what was generated and where the output files are.

## Notes

- **Audio stream language tags are unreliable.** yt-dlp sometimes tags Japanese audio as "English" because YouTube's metadata is wrong. When using subs2cia with `-tl ja`, this can cause it to skip the correct audio stream. For YouTube downloads, use `-ai 0` to explicitly select the first (usually only) audio stream rather than relying on language matching.
