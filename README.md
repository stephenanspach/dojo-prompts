# Dojo Prompts — AI Skills for Japanese Learners

AI-powered skills for immersion-based Japanese learning. Each skill is a structured workflow that an AI coding agent walks you through — find content, create subtitles, study with Anki, and build a speaking style modeled on a native speaker you admire.

These skills are designed for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) but can be adapted for Codex or other AI coding agents.

## The workflow

1. **[Content Discovery](content-discovery.md)** — Find Japanese content that matches your personal taste, not generic "top 10 for learners" lists
2. **[Process Content](process-content.md)** — Give it a YouTube URL and it handles the rest: processes with yt-dlp, transcribes, and lets you pick which outputs you want
3. **[Primed Listening](primed-listening.lua)** — mpv script that pauses after each subtitle line, giving you time to read before listening
4. **[Style Guide](style-guide.md)** — Analyze a native speaker's transcripts to create a speaking style guide you can internalize

`/process-content` orchestrates the individual skills below — you can also run them directly:

- **[Create SRT](create-srt.md)** — Generate Japanese subtitles from video using ElevenLabs Scribe speech-to-text and MeCab bunsetsu segmentation
- **[Translate SRT](translate-srt.md)** — Translate the Japanese subtitles into English for reference
- **Condensed Audio** — Use [subs2cia](https://github.com/mattvsjapan/subs2cia) to extract just the spoken audio for passive listening
- **[Primed Summaries](primed-summaries.md)** — Group sentences into topical chunks with English summaries, producing an SRT for primed-listening audio (English preview → original audio for the chunk → next preview)
- **[Anki](anki.md)** — Generate Anki decks from your content with audio clips and subtitle text
- **[Find Mistakes](find-mistakes.md)** — Analyze a transcript of you speaking Japanese to identify recurring mistakes and unnatural patterns, optionally generating an Anki deck of corrections

## Installation

1. Open your study folder in Claude Code
2. Paste: `git clone https://github.com/mattvsjapan/dojo-prompts`
3. Paste: `cp dojo-prompts/CLAUDE.md .`

That's it. Claude Code will now recognize your language learning requests and use the right skill automatically. Just say things like "help me discover content" or "process this YouTube video" and it will know what to do.

### Primed Listening (mpv script)

The primed listening script needs to be installed separately into mpv:

```bash
cp primed-listening.lua ~/.config/mpv/scripts/
```

Press `n` in mpv to toggle it on/off. See the file header for all keybindings.

### As standalone prompts

All skills also work as plain prompts — paste the contents into any AI chat (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) and follow the instructions.

## Requirements

- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) for processing YouTube content
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) (with `ffprobe`) — used to strip video and upload audio only when transcribing, and by the condensed-audio/Anki steps
- A speech-to-text API key for transcription (create-srt, find-mistakes, style-guide) — an [ElevenLabs API key](https://elevenlabs.io/) with Scribe access (`$ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`).
- [mpv](https://mpv.io/) media player (for primed listening)
- Python packages: `fugashi`, `unidic-lite`, `genanki`, `requests`
- [subs2cia](https://github.com/mattvsjapan/subs2cia) — **you must use this fork**, not the original. It adds context column support and other features used by the subs2srs and condensed audio steps. Install with:
  ```bash
  python3 -m pip install --break-system-packages git+https://github.com/mattvsjapan/subs2cia.git
  ```

## Part of Immersion Dojo

These skills are part of the **[Immersion Dojo](https://mvj.link/dojo)** course on Skool. They're open source so the community can use, improve, and adapt them.
