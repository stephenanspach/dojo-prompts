# Create SRT

Generate natural Japanese subtitles from a video file using a speech-to-text provider (ElevenLabs Scribe v2 or Soniox) and MeCab bunsetsu segmentation.

## Usage

Run `/create-srt <video_file>` to generate an SRT file from a video.

## Requirements

```
pip install fugashi unidic-lite requests
```

An API key for whichever provider you choose:
- **ElevenLabs** — `$ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` (Scribe access)
- **Soniox** — `$SONIOX_API_KEY`

## Workflow

### 1. Get the video file path and choose a provider

Get the video file path from the argument or ask the user.

**Ask the user which speech-to-text provider to use: ElevenLabs Scribe v2 or Soniox.** Both produce the same transcript JSON, so every downstream step is identical — the choice only affects transcription quality/speed and which API key is needed.

Make sure the chosen provider's key is set. If not, ask the user to paste it and export it for the session:

```bash
export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="<key from user>"   # if ElevenLabs
export SONIOX_API_KEY="<key from user>"        # if Soniox
```

### 2. Transcribe

Run the transcribe helper with the chosen provider. It transcribes with character-level timestamps and diarization, then writes a transcript JSON in the canonical shape (same shape regardless of provider). Use `-o` to name the output after the video file:

```bash
python3 dojo-prompts/scripts/transcribe.py --provider <elevenlabs|soniox> --language ja -o <video_stem> video.mp4
```

This produces `<video_stem>.json` (e.g., `kikai_onchi_01.mp4` → `kikai_onchi_01.json`) so all outputs share a consistent basename.

Notes:
- **ElevenLabs** is a single synchronous request. Files up to 3GB; longer videos can take a few minutes.
- **Soniox** runs an async job (upload → transcribe → poll). The helper handles polling and deletes the uploaded file from your account when done.
- **Transcribe one file at a time.** STT accounts have low concurrency limits, and concurrent uploads fail with mid-upload connection resets. For multiple videos, run transcriptions sequentially — never in parallel subagents. (The helper retries transient failures with backoff, but it cannot beat an over-limit account.)
- Do not request `additional_formats` — we build the SRT ourselves from the raw word data.

### What the output looks like

Both providers write the same canonical JSON structure:

```json
{
  "language_code": "jpn",
  "language_probability": 1.0,
  "text": "Full transcript as a single string...",
  "words": [
    {
      "text": "[オープニングミュージック]",
      "start": 0.28,
      "end": 12.28,
      "type": "audio_event",
      "speaker_id": "speaker_0",
      "logprob": -0.057
    },
    {
      "text": " ",
      "start": 13.66,
      "end": 13.72,
      "type": "spacing",
      "speaker_id": "speaker_0",
      "logprob": 0.0
    },
    {
      "text": "世",
      "start": 13.72,
      "end": 13.86,
      "type": "word",
      "speaker_id": "speaker_1",
      "logprob": -0.018
    }
  ],
  "transcription_id": "..."
}
```

Key things to know:
- For Japanese, each character is returned as a separate "word" entry. We concatenate them ourselves and use MeCab to find natural bunsetsu (phrase) boundaries.
- `type` is one of: `"word"` (actual text), `"spacing"` (whitespace, skip these), `"audio_event"` (music, laughter, etc. in brackets).
- `speaker_id` identifies different speakers (useful for diarization).
- `start` and `end` are timestamps in seconds.
- Do not request `additional_formats` from the API — we build the SRT ourselves from the raw word data.

### 3. Generate the SRT with MeCab bunsetsu segmentation

MeCab with UniDic segments Japanese text into bunsetsu (phrase units), so subtitles break at natural grammatical boundaries.

Run the conversion script, using `-o` to name the output after the video file:
```bash
python3 dojo-prompts/scripts/srt_watch.py -o <video_stem> <video_stem>.json
```

This produces `<video_stem>.srt` alongside the JSON file.

### 4. Preserve the JSON

**Do NOT delete the transcript JSON file.** It is needed by other workflows (Anki deck generation, English translation). Only the SRT is the final output of this skill, but the JSON must be kept.

## Tuning parameters

Key constants are defined in `scripts/srt_common.py` and `scripts/srt_watch.py`:

| Parameter | Default | Effect |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| `GAP_THRESHOLD` | 0.1s | Time gap that forces a segment break between bunsetsu. |
| `MERGE_GAP_LIMIT` | 0.4s | Segments this far apart are never merged into one line. |
| `LINE_CHAR_LIMIT` | 18 | Max characters per subtitle line. |
